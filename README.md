# python-crash-course
Repository for projects, labs, and tests for the No Starch Press book 'Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition' by Eric Matthes. 

I am but a noob coder, so if you're looking through this for some reason and happen to see changes that are worth making, feel free to let me know.

Update: Added a Discord webhook so my updates are reflected in my feed channel. This part is only here because I'm testing that out. Let's see if it works.
